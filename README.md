### LAN Scanner

> View active devices in your network

Uses nmap to detect them  and tkinter to display them. Sometimes, nmap does not detect all devices in the first run, so press refresh an the new devices will be added using a different color!

- you can match MAC addresses to devices in the code
- specify your network in the code

usage:
```bash
sudo python3 nmaplocalscan.py
```
